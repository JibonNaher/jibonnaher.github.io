        <h1>Welcome to the information page</h1>
        <p>This is part of a research study on reddit, conducted by researchers at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.</p>
        <p>In this work, we developed an initial algorithm for detecting special pattern (e.g., social greetings, insulting, provoking) in text. 
          As part of the research, we sent a message to a reddit user when we detect a special pattern by our algorithm.
          Then, we collected public commenting data for one week of the user to update our algorithm. 
          We selected some users (users who are participating actively in r/AskReddit) for this purpose. 
          You are one of this users.</p>

            username in any phase of the research. </p> 
        <p>However, you can restrict whether we can use the collected comment data of your's or not. 
          Since the data is publicly available, if you don't provide any option within one week, by default, we will consider
           the selection as <b>Yes</b>.</p>
        <p>Please pick an option, and provide your reddit username, we will take action accordingly.
